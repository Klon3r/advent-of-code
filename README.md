# Advent of code

This repository contains my yearly attempts at **Advent of Code**

**Advent of Code** is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming chalenges that follow the story of the North Pole elves making necessary preparations for smooth festivity operations. It is created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/projects/)

**Requirements (Self imposed)**

- Choose a different programming language every year
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Have fun (Doesn't matter if I don't finish all the questions)

# 2025

After thinking of what programming language I would pick for this year, I decided that for the 2025 I would choose the programming language Go.

**Reasons**

- Go is a widely loved language and well-suited for backend development
- Mascot +1 (Who doesn't love the this adorable lil' gopher)
